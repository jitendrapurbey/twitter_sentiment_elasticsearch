# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Elasticsearch

In this, we’ll connect to the Twitter Streaming API, gather tweets (based on a keyword), calculate the sentiment of each tweet, and build a real-time dashboard using the Elasticsearch DB and Kibana to visualize the results.

# Twitter Streaming API
In order to access the Twitter Streaming API, you need to register an application at http://apps.twitter.com. Once created, you should be redirected to your app’s page, where you can get the consumer key and consumer secret and create an access token under the “Keys and Access Tokens” tab. Add these to a new file called config.py.

# Elastic stack
Download elastic stack from http://elastic.co and install it to see the visualization in action.
